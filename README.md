# Caseta2Mqtt
A gateway to connect a Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge Pro and MQTT.

## Installation
The application must be running on the same network as the Smart Bridge Pro.

### Docker
A docker container is available to host this application, and can be installed by running:
- `docker run markjohnson/caseta2mqtt`

### Node.js
If you have Node.js installed locally, you can run the application by doing the following:
1. Clone or download this repo into a folder.
2. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
3. Run `npm start` to run the application.

### Manually
Running `npm run build`, will compile the source into `./dist`.
The contents of that folder can be copied and run independently.
Executing `index.js` with Node.js will start the application.

## Other Resources
I originally created this for use with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
via MQTT. If just want to integrate a Smart Bridge and don't need MQTT, check out this
custom Home Assistant component:

In my case I wanted to control my Caseta devices over MQTT. There didn't seem to be anything
like this out there at the time, so I decided to build it. It wasn't until after I we nearly
finished that I discovered Zach Wily had started a similar project shortly after that.
Check that project out here:

The overall design for this application was heavily inspired by Zwave2Mqtt, which
accomplishes the same thing with Z-Wave. If you've got Z-Wave devices you'd like to
communicate with via MQTT, check out this project:

The Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge Pro exposes a telnet-based API for communication on a local
network. It's not officially supported but fortunately I didn't have to reverse engineer it,
thanks to this documentation:
